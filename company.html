        <h3>Application of this policy</h3>
        <p>This policy applies to the personal data we process in relation to members, former members and individuals who are on our mailing list and to the use of that personal data in any form – whether oral, electronic or written.</p>

        <h3>What Personal Data do we Collect from You?</h3>

        <li>details of your visits to the website (including traffic data) and the resources that you access (please see our Cookie Policy on our website for further detail); and</li>

Photographs and videos will be used in such a way that will have minimal privacy impact upon an individual.  Otherwise, where we take photographs or videos in our gyms for marketing purposes and the video or photograph is of an individual, we will ask the individual whether they are happy to be on the photograph/video and will not publish it without their consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special Categories of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>There may be instances in which the personal data that you provide to us or we collect is considered to be special categories of personal data under data protection law.  Special categories of personal data can include racial or ethnic origin; genetic data; biometric data for the purpose of identifying an individual; data concerning health or data concerning your sex life or sexual orientation.  </p>
        <p>Please note that we require certain personal data (including special categories of personal data which relates to your health status and your biometric data) in order to be able to provide you with access to the gym and for health and safety reasons.  If you do not provide such information, this may impact our ability to offer the use of our services to you.  Where we process special categories of personal data, we will ask you for your explicit consent in order to do this.</p>
        <p>If you volunteer information to us that contains special categories of personal data, you will be regarded as giving your explicit consent to us processing it.  We will seek to confirm with you that this is the case unless we have a legitimate reason for not doing so.</p>
        <p>We collect personal data directly from you when you complete our forms, we contact you or you contact us, whether submitted on the website, electronically or in person.</p>
        <h3>How We Use Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>We process personal data concerning members and those on our mailing list for several reasons which relate to providing our gym services to that member.  These reasons include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>administering and managing your membership to the gym;</li>
        <li>communicating with you, including to send marketing to you in respect of products, services and offers, which we feel will be of interest to you (unless you have opted out of receiving such marketing communications);</li>
        <li>forming our marketing and retention strategies through a) profiling and automated decision-making i.e. analysing data we collect from varying sources (e.g. from your use of two or more of our products and/or services, to help give our members a more personalised experience); and b) data captured in generic/group gym photography and videos taken in our gyms;</li>
        <li>maintaining and improving the service we offer our members; and</li>
        <li>complying with applicable laws (e.g., laws governing health and safety and having in place appropriate insurance for our business activities)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The legal basis on which we rely for processing your data for these purposes is that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party; complying with our legal obligations; and in order to fulfil our legitimate interests of providing you with an excellent standard of service, which includes providing you with information about products, services and offers that we feel will be of relevance and interest to you.</p>
        <p>Where we send marketing communications by electronic means (such as phone, SMS or email) we will obtain your consent.  Where you have provided consent, please note that you may withdraw it at any time.  This shall not affect the lawfulness of any processing that was based on your consent before you withdrew it.</p>
        <h3>Monitoring in the Gym</h3>
        <p>There are CCTV cameras in operation within and around our gyms.</p>
        <p>The legal basis on which we rely in respect of using CCTV is that this processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by the Company.  For example, images recorded may be used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>to prevent and detect crime in our gyms;</li>
        <li>to protect the health and safety of members, colleagues and visitors; and</li>
