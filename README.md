# Exercise 4 Less Gymm website

The main purpose of this project is to inform potential members, who want to know more about theb gym and it procedures. Secondly the website can be used by the the owner to help attract and retain members.  

 
## UX

Here are some user stories:

- As a potential member, I want to contact customer service, so that I can apply for a member ship or ask questions.
- As a member, I want to contact customer service, so that I can report issues or enquire about other membership plans.

- As a potential member, I want to check reviews, so that I can make a more informed decision on which membership or gym I should join.
- As a member, I want to check reviews, so that I can be more aware of how to gym changes for different people.

- As a potential member, I want to see what services are provided, so that I can understand what I get when I join and what classes I can got to.
- As a member, I want to see what services are provided, so that I can make better use of my membership.

- as a potential member, I want to have a look at the gallery of people who go to the gym, to make sure other people who go are seeing results and that would help me make my decision on commiting.
- as a member, I want to see the gallery of other peopl i go gym with, this helps me stay motivated and strive to do more.

- as a potential member, I would like to be able to sign up for a membership, because I want to immediatly start working out when I go gym rather then do lots of admin.
- as a member, I want to sign up for a different membership, as some have better benefits or is cheaper for me.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. Sign up form:
    1. Go to the "Sign Up" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



3. Class carousel:
   1.Go to "Services" page
   2.Click on the next or before to test responsiveness

4. Image carousel:
   1.Go to "Gallery" page
   2.Click on the next or before to test responsiveness


The best part for using bootstrap is that the website is very reponsive and can be easy desinged with different users in mind. My website is very responsive to different screen sizes.


there where a few bugs that I ran with using js but tgat was mostly user implementation error as I didnt know the position of where you put your scripts mattered. So everytime I tryed to use validation but it didn't work. Later after figuring out that you have to put the script after the elements that are affected or needed to be loaded before the script could run.


## Deployment

To start I used a completely different repository for this project originally however I spoke to my mentor and we brainstprmed some ideas on how to improve my project. One of the ideas was to comptly start a new repository and impliment bootstrap framework from the beginning, rather then trying to rework my html and css.

To deploy the website on github pages was straight forward, all I had to do was change the settings in for my github repository.
Making this reposity the master branch and public from private.

There was no sepreate branches as i a used jsfiddle.com to experiment and test.

Run my code locally i download the repository and then open up my browser, then using file:// and the location pf my code stored locally.
